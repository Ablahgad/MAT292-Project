# MAT292 Project: CFD Solver - Ciara Browne, Nancy Fang, and Ablah Gadallah
A CFD solver for modelling the motion of a Zebrafish in water using a finite difference numerical model.

## Instructions
All code can be run from the [velocity_field_visualizer.mlx file](velocity_field_visualizer.mlx). Within this MATLAB file the code for running the finite difference solver, as well as significant outputs are included. To display the solver velocity field output run the MATLAB file. The actual solver may be found in the [Finite_difference.py file](Finite_difference.py).
